# FIB-Algorithmics-Project














---

This project was made for the Algorithmics 22/23 Q2 course of FIB-UPC. It includes several algorthms which solve the minimum influence set selection in a social network based on Kempe et. al paper "Maximizing the Spread of Influence through a Social Network". The report of this project is in the file `documentacio.pdf`. The experimental section could not be 100% completed.

## How to use
To try the algorithms just compile them individually as regular cpp files and execute them taking any graph as an input. For example: `./localSearchIC < instances/graph_jazz.dimacs`
